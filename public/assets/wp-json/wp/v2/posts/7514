However, before you can start sending texts to your customers, you must first choose your SMS gateway provider, that is, the service provider which will actually deliver your messages to your customers\u2019 phones. The decision is not so simple and there are a number of important considerations one must take into account before settling on a provider that suits your requirements. The following are the most important issues you need to keep in mind when making your choice:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img width=\"323\" height=\"199\" src=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Deliverability-ratio.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7529\" srcset=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Deliverability-ratio.png 323w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Deliverability-ratio-300x185.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Deliverability ratio<\/strong>: The deliverability ratio is the ratio of the total number of messages which are to be sent and the actual number of messages which are received by the customers. It follows from the definition that in an ideal scenario where all messages sent out reach their respective destinations, the deliverability ratio will be one. However, in reality the deliverability ratio is always more than that due to several factors which influence deliverability, some of which are outside the control of the SMS gateway provider. Other factors, though, are in the provider\u2019s control, like the authenticity of the SMS and the sender, network coverage of SMS gateways, filtered out customer profiles etc. These latter factors are the reason why deliverability ratio will vary between different vendors and it is hence crucial to choose a gateway provider with the lowest deliverability ratio. Doing so will ensure that your messages are much more likely to reach your customers.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Multiple-telecom-network-integration.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7517\" width=\"338\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Multiple-telecom-network-integration.png 338w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Multiple-telecom-network-integration-300x209.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"2\"><li><strong>Multiple telecom network integration<\/strong>: As a business, your goal should be to reach your customers wherever they are and whichever telecom network they are on.
