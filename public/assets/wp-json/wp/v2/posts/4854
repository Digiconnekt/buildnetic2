Within the first month, we got half a million users<\/a>. Initially, the team was not experienced to handle the scale. We faced almost all possible issues, a spike in server costs, hacking attacks, user acquisition, retention. However, we kept learning from failures and successes, leading to &#8211; 30 Million users who loved our app.<\/p>\n<p>In this journey, we understood &#8211; to run a technology business requires both agility to move fast as well as consistency to deliver results. To share our experience and learnings with tech entrepreneurs we are offering IT development services as Steady Rabbit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your company\u2019s business model\u2013in-house team or third party vendors\/ outsourcing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have an in-house team. It allows us to work cohesively as a single group<\/p>\n<p>Each team member is well versed with the agile methodology, which helps to cater to the most demanding situation of a business. Further, we believe in delivering quick and effective solutions. Having an in house team makes our business and technical processes seamless, both in terms of intra and inter-team collaboration.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your company differentiate itself from the competition?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our company motto is simply \u2018Expect more from us\u2019 on every front.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do we deliver on expectations?<\/strong> &#8211; our experience as a product company that scaled to 30 Mn users. We understand product-related problems related to security, scalability, and reliability. So while working on your <a href=\"\/application-development-technology-offerings\/\">IT products<\/a> and solutions, we know the challenges ahead and build a strong IT foundation.<\/p>\n<p>Further, we have created development processes and checklists to ensure that your products have an edge over the competition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What industries do you generally cater to? Are your customers repetitive? If yes, what ratio of clients has been repetitive to you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our clientele belongs to a diverse industry domain &#8211; ranging from e-commerce, retail, gaming, healthcare, entertainment. We are open to all domains.<\/p>\n<p>We are still young to have an indicator that can provide a correct picture of the client retention. As of now, we have 100% client retention. If we did not get any repeat projects from clients, it was only because they were one-time in nature and clients did not have further IT requirements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please share some of the services that you offer for which clients approach you the most for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our key IT Development services include <a href=\"\/product-engineering-services\/\">Product Engineering<\/a>, <a href=\"\/custom-mobile-application-development\/\">Mobility<\/a>, <a href=\"\/cloud-management-and-devops-services\/\">DevOps<\/a>, <a href=\"\/business-analytics-services\/\">Analytics<\/a>, <a href=\"\/migration-upgrade-and-product-re-engineering\/\">Product re-engineering<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/mobile-web-application-testing-services\/\">Testing<\/a>. We offer both Web and Mobile App development as well as custom software development. We are best suited for Small and Medium Enterprise clients including Startups who are looking for timely delivery within specified budgets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your customer satisfaction rate according to you? What steps do you take to cater to your customer\u2019s needs and requirements?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our Motto is \u201cExpect more from us\u201d. All processes are framed to achieve client delight. For us nothing less than 100% customer satisfaction is acceptable. And it is 100% as per the recent survey we had conducted.<br \/>\nIn rare cases when there is a change of requirement, normally we keep a time-buffer to accommodate minor changes. However, when the difference is too wide, we discuss the changes with clients and present the best quote for the budget approval. In all cases so far, clients have responded positively to our budget change requests. We have ourselves been a product company and therefore understand the importance of timely delivery within budgets, so all cases are resolved amicably without compromising on project progress.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What kind of support system do you offer to your clients for catering to their queries and issues?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Client satisfaction is a top priority for us. To ensure that, firstly, we provide a dedicated account manager to your project. Depending on the project, we set up a weekly or fortnightly call with the account manager to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Besides that, if required, the project manager is available on a phone call and Skype Messenger. \u00a0Most importantly, we have a very transparent project management system such as Jira and Basecamp, that allows the client to track the progress of the project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What kind of payment structure do you follow to bill your clients? Is it Pay per Feature, Fixed Cost, Pay per Milestone (could be in phases, months, versions etc.)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We offer flexible engagement models for our clients, namely, Fixed Cost and Time and Material basis.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed Cost &#8211;<\/strong>\u00a0Once our Business Analyst has defined the scope of the work, we readily quote a price and duration of the project.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time and Material Basis &#8211;<\/strong>\u00a0Hourly rates of each resource would be decided and agreed upon in the contract. The cost of the project is based on the number of hours devoted by each of the resources.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dedicated Resources &#8211;<\/strong>\u00a0Engineers whose 100% time is dedicated to ensuring continuous delivery of your project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yes, we accepted payments in phases, which can be discussed as per the type and depth of the project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you take in projects which meet your basic budget requirement? If yes, what is the minimum requirement? If not, on what minimum budget you have worked for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/\">Steady Rabbit<\/a>\u2019s minimum budget requirement is USD 10,000. Exceptions are made when we need to present a POC for a larger size project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the price range (min and max) of the projects that you catered to in 2019?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are glad to say that due to the amazing <a href=\"\/success-story\/\">client response<\/a> we have received since we started as an IT services organisation. We have received projects of ticket size USD 5000 to USD 80,000.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see your company in the next 10 years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Reliable and trustworthy are two words that we want to used to describe Steady Rabbit. And, we are leaving no stone unturned to achieve this. How? Our team has created sound processes that allow us to deliver projects with a 30-40% lower cost than what is charged in the market while promising higher quality of work at the same time. How do we do this? We have achieved this by synergistic alliances in every department. So, for instance, right from gathering the requirement to translating it to the final product &#8211; we ensure to minimise losses when the output of one department moves to the next one.<\/p>\n<p>So we are confident that in the next 10 years, we would perfect ourselves in the art of delivering high-quality projects at economical cost.<\/p>\n<p>Explore our services, and <a href=\"\/contact-us\/\">connect<\/a> with our experts.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please introduce your company and give a brief about your role within the organisation.
