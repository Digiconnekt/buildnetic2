Client-side and server-side are also known by their archaic names \u2013 frontend and backend. Web development uses specific tools and frameworks to render beautiful looking, robust, and dynamic websites.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The browser or the application window runs stuff written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interface for users to interact. This is good enough for single-page, or multi-page, websites that have static pages \u2013 pages that show the same content every time you access it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if there is a need to display content that must change \u2013 depending on who is viewing it, when, and where \u2013 we look up to server-side tools and frameworks. Hence, for user authentication, login verification, and data security acquainting oneself with server-side technologies becomes tremendously important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to select the right technology for you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like every other thing that involves people, this one too has developers swearing by the technologies that they are most comfortable with; everything else for them is muck. Many a time they go out of their way to advocate and later draft articles and reams of pages eulogising a particular tech and berating others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there is this never-ending discussion on whether you should choose a programming language or a framework for a project. Old-schoolers, without missing a beat, would say \u2018Languages\u2019. However, do bear in mind that developing an app or a website in a programming language has its downsides.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Languages require a huge amount of code to be written; throw in the quirks of each developer and you can have an app whose efficiency is a disaster.<\/li><li>A badly commented code can be a disaster in terms of readability.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A framework has predefined functions that can make development and readability a breeze.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple frameworks are in vogue today; so much so that an average dev is spoilt for choices. There are a couple of metrics that may clear the air and help you make a decision on the one that suits your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Productivity<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5373\" src=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/A-Curtain-Raiser-to-Backend-Technologies.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/A-Curtain-Raiser-to-Backend-Technologies.png 800w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/A-Curtain-Raiser-to-Backend-Technologies-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/A-Curtain-Raiser-to-Backend-Technologies-768x411.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Frameworks are of two kinds \u2013 opinionated and unopinionated. An opinionated framework is designed keeping in mind specific design patterns and thus allows no flexibility to developers. These assumptions are difficult to violate and can create issues like enforced conventions, lack of extensibility, and in some cases restriction to a particular toolset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unopinionated frameworks are more flexible, extensible, and support a variety of toolsets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing one of these is crucial as they may impact or enhance your team\u2019s productivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learning Curve<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frameworks with steep learning curves create problems in terms of finding developers with the right skill. If you have a team of less experienced developers, bringing them up to speed and abreast with your choice of the framework may be an uphill task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Popularity<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most underrated metrics. A less popular framework catering to a niche may have lower community support and poor documentation. It may not sound much but when faced with a certain challenge, your team may be in a doldrum until a solution or an update in the form of fair wind comes across.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Server-side frameworks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us review some of the popular frameworks and see which of them suits your needs. Here we have considered \u2013 Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), and NodeJS (JavaScript).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"\/custom-nodejs-application-development\/\">NodeJS<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5329\" src=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-Proverbial-App-Skeleton-\u2013-A-Curtain-Raiser-to-Backend-Technologies-\u2013-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"744\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-Proverbial-App-Skeleton-\u2013-A-Curtain-Raiser-to-Backend-Technologies-\u2013-4.png 800w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-Proverbial-App-Skeleton-\u2013-A-Curtain-Raiser-to-Backend-Technologies-\u2013-4-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/The-Proverbial-App-Skeleton-\u2013-A-Curtain-Raiser-to-Backend-Technologies-\u2013-4-768x411.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/\">web development framework<\/a> is written in JavaScript and has been around for at least 11 years (initial release May 2009). Since it uses JavaScript as its language, it has a plus of using the same language on the server-side and the client-side. This feature alone makes sending and syncing data between the client and the server stress-free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One may argue that <a href=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/custom-nodejs-application-development\/\">NodeJS<\/a> is not a framework but a runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server-side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"443\" src=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Img12-1-6-1024x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Img12-1-6-1024x443.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Img12-1-6-300x130.jpg 300w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Img12-1-6-768x332.jpg 768w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Img12-1-6.jpg 1065w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Asynchronous \u2013 The runtime is event-driven which helps concurrent handling of requests.<\/li><li>I\/O non-blocking \u2013 Since no NodeJS function explicitly performs the input and output, there are no process blocks.
