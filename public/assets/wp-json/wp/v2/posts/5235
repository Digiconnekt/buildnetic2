Every day we hear about a new frontend framework that promises to take the development world by storm but vanishes sooner than a proverbial wisp in the wind. This has further contributed to an overabundance of articles and guides that often proven to be more confusing than helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following image attempts to showcase the available frameworks:<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5349\" src=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Why-users-may-love-an-app-made-in-React-\u2013-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Why-users-may-love-an-app-made-in-React-\u2013-2.png 800w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Why-users-may-love-an-app-made-in-React-\u2013-2-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Why-users-may-love-an-app-made-in-React-\u2013-2-768x411.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Frontend development or client-side development has always been relegated to \u2018making things pretty\u2019 while conveniently forgetting that frontend development requires both artistic compassion and programmatic meticulousness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Can One Make the Correct Choice?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a firm in its initial stages of product development, it is understandable if you are confused and at a stage where you must make a tough choice. Thankfully, there\u2019s a litmus test that can help you make this decision faster. As most of the frontend frameworks focus on accessibility and responsiveness, we shall drop it in favour of other parameters such as:<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5350\" src=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Why-users-may-love-an-app-made-in-React-\u2013-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Why-users-may-love-an-app-made-in-React-\u2013-4.png 800w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Why-users-may-love-an-app-made-in-React-\u2013-4-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/steadyrabbit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Why-users-may-love-an-app-made-in-React-\u2013-4-768x411.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Performance<\/strong>: How much time does the app take to become usable?<\/li><li><strong>Size<\/strong>: How big is the app?
